## Problem Statement
In the dynamic realm of real estate, Zipco Real Estate Agency faces significant data challenges. The current data processing workflow is inefficient, leading to disparate datasets, inconsistent formats, and delays in obtaining critical property information.

Data engineers are tasked with managing a diverse range of data sources, resulting in increased operational costs, compromised data quality, and delays in decision-making. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive ETL pipeline that not only streamlines data processes but also establishes a foundation for scalable and automated data management, ensuring Zipco remains competitive in the real estate market.

## Objectives
- **Automation:** Create an automated ETL pipeline that runs at defined intervals, with logging and monitoring to track performance and identify issues.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Implement robust procedures to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Extraction:** Develop a Python-based solution to fetch property records from the Real Estate API.
- **Database Loading:** Design an optimized process to efficiently insert transformed data into the PostgreSQL database.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Streamline the data processing workflow, reducing manual intervention and ensuring timely updates.
- **Improved Data Quality:** Address inconsistencies and enhance overall data quality through cleaning and transformation processes.
- **Cost Reduction:** Minimize operational costs associated with manual data processing by automating the ETL pipeline.
- **Scalability:** Design a scalable solution that can handle increased data volumes as Zipco Real Estate Agency expands its operations.
